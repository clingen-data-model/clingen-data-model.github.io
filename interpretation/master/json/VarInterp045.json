  "explanation": "The c.631-2A>G variant in DSC2 has been reported in 1 Caucasian individual with ARVC (Heuser 2006). This variant has also been identified by our laboratory in 2 individuals (1 with ARVC and 1 with LVNC). This variant has been reported in 1/66564 European chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs397514042). This variant occurs in the invariant region (+/- 1,2) of the splice consensus sequence and in vitro studies confirmed that it leads to aberrant splicing and reduced DSC2 protein levels (Heuser 2006). Splice and other loss-of-function variants in DSC2 have been reported in individuals with ARVC (http://arvcdatabase.info/). In summary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, the c.631-2A>G variant is likely pathogenic.",
