  "explanation": "This variant occurs in the invariant region (+/- 1,2) of the splice consensus sequence and in vitro studies confirmed that it leads to aberrant splicing and reduced DSC2 protein levels (Heuser 2006 PMID: 17186466). Splice and other loss-of-function variants in DSC2 have been reported in individuals with ARVC (http://arvcdatabase.info/).",
