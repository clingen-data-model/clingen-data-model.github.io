  "comments": "Suggested that this rule is NOT appropriate for LOF variants.\nAlso, note that when the region of interest is a “well-established functional domain” then it’s not necessary to show through evidence that it is intolerant of benign missense variants.  However, when a mutational hotspot is being defined, then showing it does not have benign missense variants is important."
