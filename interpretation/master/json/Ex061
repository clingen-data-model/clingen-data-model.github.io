  "description": "NM_001103.3(ACTN2):c.1484C>T (p.Thr495Met)\n\nIn a family tested by the LMM, the c.1484C>T variant was identified in a proband with clinical diagnosis of HCM. This proband has two relatives that also have clinical diagnosis of HCM however never relative carries the c.1484C>T variant. \n\nBS4 is applicable for this variant - especially since there are two non-segregations in this family\n\n(As a sidenote, this variant would be a good one to use in the interface or to test rule application, because there is segregation in another family - so theoretically PP1 and BS4 could be used)"
