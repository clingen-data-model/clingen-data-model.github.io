This proband has two relatives that also have clinical diagnosis of HCM however never relative carries the c.1484C>T variant. \n\nBS4 is applicable for this variant - especially since there are two non-segregations in this family\n\n(As a sidenote, this variant would be a good one to use in the interface or to test rule application, because there is segregation in another family - so theoretically PP1 and BS4 could be used)",
