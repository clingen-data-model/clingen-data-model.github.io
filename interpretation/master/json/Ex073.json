  "description": "Variant:NM_133379.3(TTN) : c.15283T>C (p.Tyr5095His) BP4 does not apply\n BP4 does not apply for this variant because it is located in exon 45A of TTN, which is difficult to sequence and in silico tools do not offer accurate predictions for it.\n\nAlignGVGD, MAPP, SIFT, and MutationTaster do not have predictions for this variant. However, PolyPhen-2 HumVar predicts that it is “possibly damaging” and HumDiv predicts that it is “Probably damaging”. These predictions cannot be trusted because of the sequencing difficulties. SIFT gives a prediction of “tolerated”."
