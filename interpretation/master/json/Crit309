  "comments": "Some groups are allowing to rule to be used if even not 100% absent\nFor instance, Cardio has allowed PM2 to be used if MAF is <0.05% with 95% CI if\nCI lower is ~0.00% (at 2 decimal places) AND CI upper is below 0.05%\n Caveat: Population data for insertions/deletions may be poorly called by next-generation sequencing"
