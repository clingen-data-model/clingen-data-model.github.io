  "description": "Variant: NM_022124.5(CDH23):c.5660C>T (p.Thr1887Ile)\n\nPathogenic variants in CDH23 are associated with Usher Syndrome Type 1, which is recessive.\n\nThis variant was identified in multiple individuals with pathogenic variants in other genes. Internal LMM data: The variant was identified in 10 probands and 2 of those probands had other pathogenic variants. One proband was had a (trans) pair of GJB2 (c.71G>A (p.Trp24x) ; c.231G>A (p.Trp77x) )\ntruncation variants and the other was homozygous for DFNB31 (now WHRN) (c.643delG (p.Val215fs)) truncating variants. \nThe proband with the GJB2 variants just had profound sensorineural hearing loss. The proband with the DFNB31/WHRN variants did have Usher Syndrome. WHRN is associated with Type 2D."
