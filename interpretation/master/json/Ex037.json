  "description": "Assessed variant: NM_000059.3(BRCA2):c.1832C>G (p.Ser611X)\n\nFrom PMID 24156927, variant was found in patient with breast ovarian cancer. Variant was also found in one relative also affected with breast ovarian cancer. Relationship to the proband unknown. BRCA2 is well established for breast ovarian cancer (dominant), however as PP1 is for “Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members” PP1 is not applicable for this variant because it’s only a single segregation."
