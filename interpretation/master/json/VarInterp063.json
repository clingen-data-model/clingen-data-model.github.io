  "explanation": "The Lys483Gln variant in BRAF has been identified in one proband with clinical features of Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and was not identified in either of this individual's parents (LMM unpublished data). This variant has not been identified in large population studies. In addition, another variant at the same residue (Lys483Asn) was identified as a de novo variant in an individual with features of a Noonan spectrum disorder (LMM unpublished data). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Lys483Gln variant may impact the normal function of the protein. In summary, this variant is likely pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.",
