  "description": "identified in 1 individual with HCM. Segregation analysis determined 5 other members of the family also carried this variant. However, only 3 of those family members had HCM (aged 48-75). The 2 other family members were young and asymptomatic. So from this paper, only count 3 segregations. The two apparently refuting segregations can be ignored due to the age-dependent penetrance of HCM.",
