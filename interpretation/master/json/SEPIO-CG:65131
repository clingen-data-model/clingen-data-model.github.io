Also, if the variant is seen in trans with a pathogenic variant in more than one individual it was felt that PM3 can be upgraded to strong. However, sites did not agree on how many additional observations were necessary to call the evidence strong (2 vs. 3) but concluded that such guidance would be useful.\n \nLMM - INCREASES IN STRENGTH IF VARIANT SEEN IN MULTIPLE COMPOUND HETS WITH DIFFERENT LIKELY PATHOGENIC/PATHOGENIC VARIANTS",
