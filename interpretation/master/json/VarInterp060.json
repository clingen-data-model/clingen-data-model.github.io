  "explanation": "The Lys483Asn variant in BRAF has not been previously reported in the literature, but has been identified as a de novo variant in one proband in our laboratory. In addition, this residue is highly conserved across evolutionarily distinct species and computational analyses (PolyPhen2, SIFT, AlignGVGD) predict that this variant will impact the normal function of BRAF. It should be noted that the sensitivity and specificity of these computational programs has not been determined by our laboratory. Therefore, this variant is likely to be pathogenic.",
