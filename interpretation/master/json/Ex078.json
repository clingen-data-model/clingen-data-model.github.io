  "description": "Variant: NM_007294.3(BRCA1):c.*6207C>T\n\nPathogenic variants in BRCA1 are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. This variant is classified as benign by ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles), which is a ClinVar expert panel. Many labs are using the classifications of ClinGen expert panels for their variant interpretations, so BP6 is met.\n(SCV000244500.1)\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/209219/"
