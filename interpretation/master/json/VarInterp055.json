  "explanation": "The Tyr337Cys variant in SOS1 has been reported in 1 individual with clinical features of Noonan syndrome (Roberts 2007), but has also been reported to be present in 2 unaffected individuals from one family (Personal Communication). This variant was absent from large population studies. Studies have shown that the Tyr337Cys variant may impact protein function by increasing its activity though these results are inconclusive and these in vitro assays may not accurately represent biological function (Smith 2013). Due to the conflicting data about this variant, the clinical significance of the Tyr337Cys variant is uncertain.",
