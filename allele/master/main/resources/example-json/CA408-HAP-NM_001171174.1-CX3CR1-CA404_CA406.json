		1. No contextualAllele link is required (need to change model).
		2. No place to add one or more display names (preferred or otherwise)
		3. Not sure if ordering of nested elements is needed.
		4. Need to remove reverse 'composite' association from model diagram/doc.
		5. We may want to separate CanonicalAllele (Simple v Complex) in the Resource model
		6. Should the nested alleles be ContextualAlleles that point to specific transcript allleles?
		7. Do we need to keep an association between AA and Nucleotide Complex canonical Alleles that are derivations?
